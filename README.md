## Objective  

Mindful Reminders is a platform that provides its user with the opportunity to integrate their wellness and mental health with their work routine. Studies show that practicing mindfulness can help employees manage mild depression, anxiety and other common mental health problems.


## User Experience

### User Stories  

- As a user I want to:

  - Integrate my work and my wellbeing.
  - Have small, manageable wellness techniques I can practice seamlessly during my workday.
  - Remember to take my breaks, for food and water.
  - Bring more structure into my personal and professional life.

## Design  

### Colour Scheme

Research conducted by Chromatherapists suggests that using shades of blue, green and yellow can evoke calm, relieve stress and elicit happy emotions. We have taken this on board and have used shades of these colours across the site.

## Features  

### Homepage  

The homepage contains a background image of a yellow toned nature scene that aims to evoke a sense of calm. The charity Mind states that bringing nature into your everyday life can benefit both your mental and physical wellbeing. During a workday, people may not have the opportunity to be present in nature. However, researchers led by Vrije University Medical Centre in the Netherlands conducted a study that shows that even just looking at images of nature could be enough to lower work stress levels. 

The Homepage contains the title, Mindful Reminders, a navigation bar and a modal pop-up form appears on opening the webpage prompting the user to set their reminders up for the day.
